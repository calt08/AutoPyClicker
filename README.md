### JUST A SCRIPT THAT AUTOCLICKS THE SPACEBAR

I created this script to help me with the selection of my teachers at college.
When you press the SpaceBar for the first time after you run the Script it starts to automatically press the SpaceBar until you press Esc key to stop the process.

I'm using Pynput library to control key pressing

#### Instructions
You need to install python and Pynput library

Run the script

SpaceBar to start
