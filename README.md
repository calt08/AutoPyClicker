### JUST A PROGRAM TO AUTOCLICK SPACEBAR

I created this script to help me with the selection of my teachers at college
When you press the SpaceBar it starts to automatically press the SpaceBar until you press Esc and the process stops

Im using Pynput to control keypressing

SpaceBar to start
ESC to end
